# Configure GitHub

The generated templates make some assumptions about how the GitHub repository
is configured. Here is a summary of changes you should do to the repository
![Settings](../../_img/settings.png){: .align-middle } to make sure everything
works as expected.

## Issues

### Labels

Review the list of labels and add:

* `part:xxx` labels that make sense to the project

* Make sure there is a `cmd:skip-release-notes` label, and if there isn't,
  create one with `930F79` as color and the following description:

    > It is not necessary to update release notes for this PR

* All labels used by automation in the project, for example look for labels listed in:

    * `.github/keylabeler.yml`
    * `.github/labeler.yml`
    * `.github/dependabot.yml`
    * `.github/workflows/release-notes-check.yml`

## Discussions

This depends on the repo, but in general we want this:

* Remove the *Show and tell* and *Poll* categories

* Rename the *Q&A* category to *Support* and change the emoji to :sos:

  This one is important to match the link provided in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`.

!!! Note inline end

    You might need to adapt the status checks in the *Protect version
    branches* ruleset depending on your repository configuration.

{% set ref_name = version.ref_name if version else default_branch %}

* [Disable creation of non-release
  tags]({{config.repo_url}}/blob/{{ref_name}}/github-rulesets/Disable creation of non-release tags.json)
* [Disable creation of other
  branches]({{config.repo_url}}/blob/{{ref_name}}/github-rulesets/Disable creation of other branches.json)
* [Disallow removal and force-pushes of

## Code

The basic code configuration should be generate using
[repo-config](https://frequenz-floss.github.io/frequenz-repo-config-python/).

## GitHub Pages

No special configuration is needed for GitHub Pages, but you need to initialize
the `gh-pages` branch. You can read how to do this in the [Initialize GitHub
Pages](index.md#initialize-github-pages.md) section.
