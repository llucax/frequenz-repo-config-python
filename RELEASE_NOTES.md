# Frequenz Repository Configuration Release Notes

## Summary



## Upgrading

<!-- Here goes notes on how to upgrade from previous versions, including deprecations and what they should be replaced with -->

### Cookiecutter template

- A new script for migrating to new templates (instead of regenerating all files) is provided. It can't handle the upgrade 100% automatically, but should make the migration process much easier and less error prone.

  To run it, the simplest way is to fetch it from GitHub and run it directly:

  ```console
  curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frequenz-floss/frequenz-repo-config-python/v0.10.0/cookiecutter/migrate.sh | sh
  ```

  Make sure the version you want to migrate to is correct in the URL.

  For jumping multiple versions you should run the script multiple times, once for each version.

  And remember to follow any manual instructions for each run.
